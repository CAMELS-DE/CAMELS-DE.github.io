## What is CAMELS-DE?

CAMELS datasets combine landscape attributes and hydrological and meteorological time series in hundreds of catchments. 
These datasets generally offer the possibility to perform and compare modeling and data analysis across a wide range of different landscapes. 
Despite having one of the most extensive hydro-meteorological sampling networks in the world, such a data set is not yet available for Germany.
The aim of the "CAMELS-DE" initiative is to provide such a comprehensive data set for Germany to the public.
